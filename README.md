# 🚀 Food Delivery Time Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **delivery time** for food orders based on various factors such as traffic conditions, weather, distance, and preparation time.  
The model uses **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** to provide actionable insights for businesses in the food delivery industry.

**Key Achievements:**
- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.
- Built a predictive model with **R² score of 0.83**.
- Identified key factors affecting delivery time: **traffic density, weather, and distance**.
- Delivered an industry-focused analysis for operational optimization.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Loading** – Read CSV data into Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, remove duplicates.
3. **EDA** – Visualize patterns and correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Transform categorical variables, scaling.
5. **Model Building** – Train/test split, train regression model.
6. **Model Evaluation** – MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
7. **Insights & Reporting** – Summarized findings with visualizations.

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 5.90 minutes
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 8.82 minutes
- **R² Score:** 0.83 (Model explains ~83% of the variance in delivery times)

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Traffic density** and **weather conditions** significantly affect delivery times.
- Longer distances and preparation times increase delivery time.
- Model can be used for **route optimization** and **delivery time estimation** in real-time.
